# Int-Java-2022-Assignment4

This assignment is meant to be short and sweet.     

If you understand the basics of polymorphism, interfaces and Generic Lists you should have no trouble at all with it.   

 

- Use the data that is generated from the “**generateDepartments()**” method and the “**generateEmployees()**” method to load those values into your “entities” List   
- Implement the “**Display**” method so it can display all the values from ***either*** an **Employee** or a **Department**.   
- In the generate methods, ***change the sample data***, so it has different first and last names, and different department names, so your names are unique, and your departments are different than the starter.     
- Don’t worry about where the values for the Id’s come from, that’s already taken care of for you in the starter, just ***make sure they are displayed in the output using their get methods.***

 

#### Everything is hardcoded and you don’t need to use a scanner object.

The sample output should look similar to this:   

Id: 1   
Department Name IT   
Id: 2   
Department Name Engineering   
Id: 3   
First Name Andre   
Last Name Boudreau   

Id: 4   
First Name Delon   
Last Name Van de Venter
